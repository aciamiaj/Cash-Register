# Cash-Register

CashRegister is an iOS application that simulates a cash register system. It allows users to select products, specify quantities, and perform transactions. The app keeps track of product stocks and transaction history.

## Features
Product Selection: Users can view a list of available products and select a product from the table view.
Quantity Input: Users can input the desired quantity of the selected product using the number buttons.
Transaction Processing: Users can initiate a transaction by clicking the "Buy" button. The app records the transaction details, updates the product stock, and displays the total price.
Stock Management: The app maintains a stock inventory for each product, deducting the sold quantity from the available stock.
Transaction History: The app keeps track of all completed transactions, including the product, quantity, and transaction date.

## Usage

The main screen will display a table view showing available products and their prices.
Tap on a product in the table view to select it. The product name will be displayed at the top, and the price will be shown next to the product in the table view.
Use the number buttons to input the desired quantity of the selected product.
The total price will be updated based on the quantity and shown in the "Total" label.
Click the "Buy" button to complete the transaction.
